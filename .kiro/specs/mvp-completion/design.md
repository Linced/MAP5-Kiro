## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Stability (Immediate)
**Goal:** Ensure existing features work reliably

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Fix any remaining login/registration issues
   - Ensure email verification works
   - Test session management

2. **File Upload System**
   - Verify 25MB limit works correctly
   - Test CSV parsing with various formats
   - Ensure error handling is robust

3. **Data Display**
   - Test table functionality with real data
   - Verify pagination and sorting work
   - Ensure responsive design

### Phase 2: Essential Features (Next)
**Goal:** Complete core MVP functionality

1. **Chart System**
   - Ensure chart creation works
   - Test with different data types
   - Add basic chart export

2. **Basic Calculations**
   - Verify formula validation
   - Test calculation execution
   - Ensure results are saved correctly

3. **User Experience**
   - Add loading states
   - Improve error messages
   - Test mobile responsiveness

### Phase 3: Polish & Deploy (Final)
**Goal:** Production-ready application

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add caching where appropriate
   - Minimize bundle size

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error boundaries
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Proper logging

3. **Deployment**
   - Production environment setup
   - Database migrations
   - Health checks

## Component Design

### Authentication System
- **Status:** Mostly complete, needs testing
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Tasks:** Test email verification, session handling

### File Upload System
- **Status:** Complete with 25MB limit
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Tasks:** Test edge cases, error handling

### Data Tables
- **Status:** Implemented, needs testing
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Tasks:** Test with large datasets, verify performance

### Chart System
- **Status:** Partially implemented
- **Priority:** Important
- **Tasks:** Complete chart builder, test chart types

### Calculation Engine
