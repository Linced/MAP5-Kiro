# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application deployed on Vercel at https://map5-nine.vercel.app cannot connect to the backend API deployed on Render. The issue is a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy blocking requests from the frontend origin to the backend API endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the frontend application, I want to be able to login successfully, so that I can access the application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits login credentials on the frontend THEN the request should successfully reach the backend API
2. WHEN the backend receives a login request from the Vercel frontend THEN it should process the request without CORS blocking
3. WHEN the backend responds to the frontend THEN the response should include proper CORS headers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend CORS configuration to be properly set up, so that the frontend can communicate with the backend API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN it should configure CORS to allow requests from https://map5-nine.vercel.app
2. WHEN a preflight OPTIONS request is made THEN the backend should respond with appropriate CORS headers
3. WHEN the CORS configuration is applied THEN it should allow the required HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure the backend deployment configuration matches the frontend expectations, so that the services can communicate properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN they should target the correct backend URL
2. WHEN the backend is deployed on Render THEN the service name should match the URL used by the frontend
3. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they should reflect the correct frontend and backend URLs
