# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TradeInsight MVP application has several navigation and routing issues that prevent users from accessing key features. The navigation bar shows links to pages that either don't exist, aren't properly routed, or have broken functionality. This affects the core user experience and prevents users from utilizing the full application functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all navigation links to work properly, so that I can access all available features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any navigation link THEN they should be taken to the correct page without errors
2. WHEN a user navigates to a page THEN the active navigation state should be properly highlighted
3. WHEN a user accesses a route THEN the page should load without JavaScript errors or missing components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the Charts page from the navigation, so that I can visualize my trading data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on "Charts" in the navigation THEN they should be taken to a functional charts page
2. WHEN the charts page loads THEN it should display chart creation and visualization tools
3. WHEN a user is on the charts page THEN the navigation should show it as the active page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation behavior across all pages, so that I have a predictable user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the layout and navigation should remain consistent
2. WHEN a user accesses any protected route THEN authentication should be properly enforced
3. WHEN a user encounters a navigation error THEN they should see helpful error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling for missing or broken routes, so that I don't encounter confusing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a non-existent route THEN they should see a helpful 404 page
2. WHEN a component fails to load THEN the user should see an appropriate error message
3. WHEN navigation fails THEN the user should be able to recover without refreshing the page
